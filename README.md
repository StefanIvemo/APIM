# APIM
This repository is used for a blog series called "Deploy APIM like a champ!" that can be found on my blog https://blog.ivemo.se. 

So, what is this blog series all about? I'm going to share my experience around APIM deployment and configuration, both basic stuff and more advanced things. I will start by deploying a simple APIM Service and then add more and more configuration along the way until we have a really good APIM infrastructure up and running. I will use ARM Templates wherever possible to make sure that we can manage APIM using CI/CD. I'm not a deveolper so focus will be more on APIM as service and all related infrastructure.

# Parts
Part 1 - Prerequisites
Part 2 - Deploy APIM with custom domain names (coming)

# Repo structure
Each part in the blog series have their own folder with templates and scripts used for that part, e.g. "Part 1 - Prerequisites".

There's also a folder named DevOps where I'll keep the entire solution as it's being built and configured for CI/CD.
